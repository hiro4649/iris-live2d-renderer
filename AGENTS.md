# AGENTS.md

## Renderer Authority Boundary

Unreadable legacy guidance was present in this file. Do not interpret that text
as project authority. For renderer product behavior, runtime readiness, assets,
model loading, or cue behavior, use the repo-local project docs and reviewer
guidance such as `docs/process/CODEX_PROJECT_AUTHORITY_REGISTRY.json` and
`docs/process/skills/renderer-readiness-reviewer.md`. If the relevant authority
is missing, ambiguous, or conflicts with the task, stop and report the risk
instead of inventing rules.

Harness-only work must stay in harness-managed files. Do not modify renderer
source, tests, specs, package files, lockfiles, runtime files, assets, or
`scripts/run-tests.js` unless the project owner explicitly requests product
work and required verification evidence is available.

CODEX_QUALITY_HARNESS_FILE v0.8.4

## Codex Target Harness Boundary

Source harness boundary: this target repository consumes Codex Development Harness v0.8.4 through docs/process/CODEX_HARNESS_MANIFEST.json, not CODEX_SOURCE_HARNESS_MANIFEST.json.
Plan-first: use a short plan for R3, workflow, product-relevant, security, release, or ambiguous changes before editing.
Safe output: reports and artifacts must be safe-summary only, with no raw PR body, comments, payloads, diffs, logs, endpoint values, private paths, production data, personal data, tokens, or secrets.
Merge-ready claim: do not claim merge readiness unless the current target gate, evidence, and required confirmations all support it.
Manual confirmation: R3 or owner-gated changes require current-head project-owner confirmation before merge.
Profile/core separation: target mode keeps profile compatibility off unless the project owner explicitly opts in.

Current target-mode requirements:
- keep this AGENTS.md readable across the whole file;
- keep exactly one current harness block;
- preserve project authority outside this block;
- run target quality gates with CODEX_HARNESS_MODE=target, CODEX_PROFILE_COMPAT_MODE=off, and CODEX_QUALITY_REPORT=json;
- allow CODEX_SKIP_NPM=1 only when change classification and product verification policy allow it;
- require product verification when product-relevant files, package files, runtime readiness claims, or performance claims are present.

v0.8.4 preserves v0.8.3 diagnostics and adds the Fast Path and Diagnostic Consolidation Gate:
- Harness Fast Path Gate;
- Diagnostic Consolidation Runner;
- Unsafe Value Class Action Matrix;
- Invalid Report Recovery v2;
- Artifact Budget and Index v2;
- PR Body Profile Optimizer;
- Open PR Hygiene v2;
- Node Actions Runtime Advisory;
- v0.8.4 self-test.

Do not add Agentmemory, Hermes runtime, GEPA, MCP, SQLite memory, LLM judge, automatic skill rewriting, auto commit, or auto push as part of this harness block.
Do not treat targetQualityScoreStatus or a passing harness gate as product runtime readiness.
