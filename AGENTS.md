## Renderer Authority Boundary

Unreadable legacy guidance was present in this file. Do not interpret that text
as project authority. For renderer product behavior, runtime readiness, assets,
model loading, or cue behavior, use the repo-local project docs and reviewer
guidance such as `docs/process/CODEX_PROJECT_AUTHORITY_REGISTRY.json` and
`docs/process/skills/renderer-readiness-reviewer.md`. If the relevant authority
is missing, ambiguous, or conflicts with the task, stop and report the risk
instead of inventing rules.

Harness-only work must stay in harness-managed files. Do not modify renderer
source, tests, specs, package files, lockfiles, runtime files, assets, or
`scripts/run-tests.js` unless the project owner explicitly requests product
work and required verification evidence is available.

## Target Harness Boundary

This repository is a downstream target using Codex Development Harness v0.8.1.
Harness work must stay in harness-managed files unless the task explicitly asks
for product code changes. Preserve readable project authority and boundary text
outside this block.

## Source Harness Boundary

The source harness is maintained outside this target repository. Do not copy
source-only manifests or require source profiles in target-mode work.

## Plan-First Rule

Use plan-first for R3, ambiguous, security-sensitive, migration, release,
dependency, multi-file, or architecture tradeoff work. Keep the plan short and
connect it to affected areas, entrypoints, and failure propagation risk.

## Safe Output Rule

Use safe summary only. Do not print raw logs, raw diffs, raw payloads, secret
values, endpoint values, private paths, production data, or personal data.

## Target Verification Rule

Harness-only changes may use `CODEX_SKIP_NPM=1`. Product-relevant changes,
runtime readiness claims, package changes, or lockfile changes require product
verification evidence and must not be hidden by npm skip.

## Merge-Ready Claim Rule

Do not claim merge-ready unless required gates, current-head evidence, CI replay
where applicable, target quality score, and human confirmation rules are
satisfied.

## Manual Confirmation Limit

Manual confirmation cannot override non-overridable failures: secret scan,
blocked paths, high-confidence sensitive findings, stale evidence, unsafe
output, product/harness scope mixing, unreadable AGENTS context, missing target
score, or weakened quality gates.

## Profile/Core Separation

Source harness version and profile template version are separate. Target mode
uses `CODEX_HARNESS_MODE=target` and does not require source profiles unless a
project explicitly opts in.
