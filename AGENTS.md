## IRIS Live2D Renderer Working Guide

This repository contains the IRIS Live2D renderer. Use Node.js >=20. Normal work
should be small, renderer-scoped, and verified with the narrowest relevant
command.

Default commands:
- Test: `npm test`
- Local server: `npm start` only when explicitly asked.

Do not claim renderer, runtime, production, or Live2D readiness unless the owner
explicitly scopes that evidence. Done means the relevant command was run or the
reason it could not run is recorded without raw logs or secret-like output.

CODEX_QUALITY_HARNESS_FILE v1.2.2

## Prime Directive

Ship the smallest correct change that increases product value without weakening
truth, trust, security, or maintainability.

## Source Harness Boundary

This repository is a downstream project consuming Codex Harness v1.2.1. v1.1.8 Final Decision, v1.1.9 orchestration, and v1.2.0 adaptive routing/review pool references below are compatibility authorities only, not active target harness versions. Work here must stay within the explicitly authorized repo and task scope. Do not edit Source HARNESS from target repo work. Product/runtime/package/workflow changes require separate owner scope.
Use `docs/process/CODEX_OPENAI_CODEX_METHOD_POLICY.md` and
`docs/process/code_review.md` as the stable method references.
For v1.0.1 through v1.0.3 outcome, recovery, fixture isolation, clean-main,
judgment consistency, product surface routing, review taxonomy, stale input,
external blocked, handover, branch/head, and local gate contract routing, use
the matching `docs/process/CODEX_*_POLICY.md` files.
For v1.0.4 claim-to-code, boundary linting, acceptance criteria, risk, evidence
v2, GitHub hysteresis, tool gap, active self-test, hotfix preservation,
PR-chain saturation, role/tool, evidence site, annotation, and Dynamic Workflow
Lite governance, use `docs/process/CODEX_V104_SPEC.md` and the matching
`docs/process/CODEX_*_POLICY.md` or schema files.
For v1.0.5 through v1.0.8 integration reliability, lane separation,
provenance, evidence closure, bounded validation, safe repair mapping,
branch isolation, review intake, manual gate audit, and controlled
orchestration, use
`docs/process/CODEX_V105_INTEGRATION_EVIDENCE_RELIABILITY_POLICY.md`,
`docs/process/CODEX_V106_LANE_PROVENANCE_RECOVERY_POLICY.md`,
`docs/process/CODEX_V107_GEAR_POLICY.md`,
`docs/process/CODEX_V108_SPEC.md`, and their schema files.
For v1.0.9 Decision Ledger and Evidence Convergence, use
`docs/process/CODEX_HARNESS_V1_0_9_DECISION_LEDGER_POLICY.md`,
`docs/process/CODEX_DECISION_LEDGER_SCHEMA_V1_0_9.json`,
`docs/process/CODEX_REPAIR_PLAN_SAFE_SCHEMA_V1_0_9.json`, and
`docs/process/CODEX_STATUS_TAXONOMY_V1_0_9.json`.
For v1.1.0 Token Economy and Operational Closure, use
`docs/process/CODEX_HARNESS_V1_1_0_TOKEN_ECONOMY_POLICY.md`,
`docs/process/CODEX_V110_SPEC.md`, and
`docs/process/CODEX_STATUS_TAXONOMY_V1_1_0.json`.
For v1.1.1 Token Hard Cap, Context Capsule, and Failure Closure, use
`docs/process/CODEX_HARNESS_V1_1_1_TOKEN_HARD_CAP_CONTEXT_CAPSULE_FAILURE_CLOSURE_POLICY.md`,
`docs/process/CODEX_V111_SPEC.md`, and
`docs/process/CODEX_STATUS_TAXONOMY_V1_1_1.json`.
For v1.1.2 Conversation Surface Minimization and Evidence Fidelity, use
`docs/process/CODEX_V112_SPEC.md`,
`docs/process/CODEX_HARNESS_V1_1_2_CONVERSATION_SURFACE_EVIDENCE_FIDELITY_POLICY.md`,
and the matching v1.1.2 taxonomy, reason dictionary, rollout manifest, and
command output policy files.
For v1.1.3 Minimal Surface, Fast Gates, Typed Decisions, and Compatibility
Proof, use `docs/process/CODEX_V113_SPEC.md`,
`docs/process/CODEX_HARNESS_V1_1_3_MINIMAL_SURFACE_FAST_GATES_COMPATIBILITY_PROOF_POLICY.md`,
and `docs/process/CODEX_STATUS_TAXONOMY_V1_1_3.json`.
For v1.1.4 Loop Kernel and Deterministic Guardrails, use
`docs/process/CODEX_V114_SPEC.md`. Preserve v1.1.3 safety profile, same-head
checks, token economy, raw-log prohibition, 8-session default fail, and target
rollout prohibition until a separate owner instruction authorizes rollout.
v1.1.4 finalizes Loop Kernel with Decision Core, Minimal Blockers, status
tiering, remote evidence state machine, forbidden scope IDs, and token cost
ledger.
For v1.1.5 Trace Kernel, Policy Hooks, Skill Profiles, and Token-Thin
Finalizer, use `docs/process/CODEX_V115_SPEC.md` and
`docs/process/CODEX_V115_PROFILE_REGISTRY.json`. Decision Core v2 is
authoritative. Minimal Blockers come first. Prefer trace pointers over repeated
history, and Skill Profile IDs over long forbidden text. Policy Hooks fail
closed. PR bodies are rendered human output, not machine decision sources.
Same-head required checks remain required. Raw logs, 8-session operation, and
product/harness repair mixing remain forbidden.
For v1.1.6 Decision Capsule, Evidence Precedence Kernel, and Token Hard Budget,
use `docs/process/CODEX_V116_SPEC.md`. Decision Capsule is the first decision
source. Evidence Precedence Kernel decides artifact priority. PR body is not
machine evidence. Token Hard Budget is enforced. Policy/profile IDs replace
long forbidden text. Same-head required checks remain mandatory. Raw logs and
8-session are forbidden. Product/harness repair separation is required. Target
rollout is not part of Source body tasks.
For v1.1.7 Outcome-Verified Decision Capsule and Artifact-Consistent Minimal
Surface, use `docs/process/CODEX_V117_SPEC.md`. Preserve Decision Capsule
authority, require concrete Outcome and read-only Verifier Capsules, prove
load-bearing artifact consistency, emit delta-only final summaries, and read
failures through safe artifacts only. Keep operator-visible statuses within the
budget and keep target rollout out of Source body tasks.
For v1.1.8 Final Decision Kernel, Evidence Capsule, Mode-Aware Artifact Contract, and Convergence Gate, use `docs/process/CODEX_V118_SPEC.md`. Preserve Final Decision authority, Evidence Capsule freshness boundaries, artifact consistency, safe failure reading, token budget enforcement, scope boundaries, same-head required checks, raw-log prohibition, 8-session default fail, and target rollout separation.
For v1.1.9 Maintainer Orchestration Lite and Worker Proof Contract, use `docs/process/CODEX_V119_SPEC.md`. v1.1.9 adds preparatory orchestration evidence only: Orchestration Capsule, Worker Proof, and Owner Decision Brief. v1.1.8 Final Decision remains final pass/block/mergeAllowed/exit-code authority. Preserve the three-artifact P0 cap, token/surface limits, safe-output rules, raw-log prohibition, 8-session default fail, product/harness separation, workflow-as-artifact-exposure-only, and target rollout separation.
For v1.2.0 Adaptive Intelligence Escalation and Review Pool, use `docs/process/CODEX_V120_SPEC.md`. v1.2.0 adds only token-aware model-tier routing, typed blockers, review-pool policy, escalation hysteresis, and high-tier repair planning inside the existing v1.1.9 P0 artifacts. Preserve v1.1.8 Final Decision authority and v1.1.9 orchestration/status compatibility. v1.2.0 must not create owner approval, GitHub approval review, release, deploy, wallet/RPC, BscScan, readiness, legal compliance, YouTube policy compliance, new P0 artifacts, scheduler behavior, external verifier runtime, memory routing, target rollout, or merge authority.



For v1.2.2 Context-Aware Skill Routing and Read Budget Discipline, use
`docs/process/CODEX_V122_SPEC.md`. v1.2.2 adds only internal
`skillContextRouting` fields inside the existing orchestration capsule when the
repo carries the full harness scripts. Read less, preserve authority: read
AGENTS.md, the active manifest, and the active v1.2.2 spec first; defer README,
legacy specs, and PR history unless task profile or safe artifact pointer
requires them. Preserve v1.1.8 Final Decision authority, v1.1.9 artifact/status
surface, v1.2.0 routing/review pool, and v1.2.1 calibration compatibility.
v1.2.2 does not add target rollout beyond this metadata/script install, product
code, package/lockfile, runtime/workflow changes, raw-log access, 8-session use,
wallet/RPC/deploy access, self approval, GitHub approval review, or readiness,
legal, or YouTube policy compliance claims.

## Plan-First Rule

Use plan-first for R3, ambiguous, security-sensitive, migration, release,
dependency, multi-file, or architecture tradeoff work. Keep the plan short and
tie it to affected areas, entrypoints, and failure propagation risk.

## Safe Output Rule

Use safe summary only. Do not print raw logs, raw diffs, raw payloads, secret
values, endpoint values, private paths, production data, or personal data.

## Merge-Ready Claim Rule

Do not claim merge-ready unless required gates, current-head evidence, CI replay
where applicable, and human confirmation rules are satisfied.

## Task Discipline

Before editing, classify work as bugfix, feature, refactor, investigation,
review, release-gate, harness-change, or docs-only. For bugfix work, use the
`codex-bugfix` skill and write reproduction status plus root-cause hypothesis
before code edits unless the change is documentation-only. Keep task-specific
workflow detail in skills or `docs/process`, not in AGENTS.md.
In 5.5 low mode, keep one PR/repo focus, avoid broad changes, and return
exactly one safe next action.

## Agent Doctrine And Skill Routing

Keep AGENTS.md as a compact doctrine and routing map. Load only the skills
needed for the task, normally four or fewer and never more than five. Route
details, review matrices, containment boundaries, state-machine evidence, and
minimal evidence rules live in `docs/process/CODEX_AGENTS_DOCTRINE_POLICY.md`,
`docs/process/CODEX_SKILL_ROUTING_POLICY.md`, and the related v0.9.5 policy
files.

## Manual Confirmation Limit

Manual confirmation cannot override non-overridable failures: secret scan,
blocked paths, high-confidence sensitive findings, stale evidence, unsafe
output, implementation/harness mixing, or weakened quality gates.

## Profile/Core Separation

Root source harness version and profile template version are separate. In
`CODEX_HARNESS_MODE=core`, profiles are optional compatibility artifacts and
must not be required for core quality score.

<!-- CODEX_QUALITY_HARNESS_END -->

For v1.2.1 Adaptive Routing Metrics and Evidence Calibration Guard, use
`docs/process/CODEX_V121_SPEC.md`. v1.2.1 target installs add only internal
calibration fields inside the existing v1.1.9 P0 artifacts: adaptive metrics,
routing calibration, evidence freshness, target score baseline, root-cause loop
guard, boundary diff classification, claim lint, owner burden metrics, and
merge decision integrity. Preserve the v1.1.8 Final Decision authority, the
v1.1.9 artifact set and operator status surface, and the v1.2.0 adaptive
routing/review pool contracts. v1.2.1 must not add new P0 artifacts,
top-level statuses, product/package/runtime/workflow changes, raw-log access,
8-session use, wallet/RPC/deploy access, self approval, GitHub approval review,
readiness claims, legal compliance claims, or YouTube policy compliance claims.
