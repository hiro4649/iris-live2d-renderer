CODEX_QUALITY_HARNESS_FILE v1.1.6

## Prime Directive

Ship the smallest correct change that increases product value without weakening
truth, trust, security, or maintainability.

## Target Harness Boundary

This repository is a downstream project consuming Codex Harness v1.1.6. Work here must stay within the explicitly authorized repo and task scope. Do not edit Source HARNESS from target repo work. Product/runtime/package/workflow changes require separate owner scope.
Use `docs/process/CODEX_OPENAI_CODEX_METHOD_POLICY.md` and
`docs/process/code_review.md` as the stable method references.
For v1.0.1 through v1.0.3 outcome, recovery, fixture isolation, clean-main,
judgment consistency, product surface routing, review taxonomy, stale input,
external blocked, handover, branch/head, and local gate contract routing, use
the matching `docs/process/CODEX_*_POLICY.md` files.
For v1.0.4 claim-to-code, boundary linting, acceptance criteria, risk, evidence
v2, GitHub hysteresis, tool gap, active self-test, hotfix preservation,
PR-chain saturation, role/tool, evidence site, annotation, and Dynamic Workflow
Lite governance, use `docs/process/CODEX_V104_SPEC.md` and the matching
`docs/process/CODEX_*_POLICY.md` or schema files.
For v1.0.5 through v1.0.8 integration reliability, lane separation,
provenance, evidence closure, bounded validation, safe repair mapping,
branch isolation, review intake, manual gate audit, and controlled
orchestration, use
`docs/process/CODEX_V105_INTEGRATION_EVIDENCE_RELIABILITY_POLICY.md`,
`docs/process/CODEX_V106_LANE_PROVENANCE_RECOVERY_POLICY.md`,
`docs/process/CODEX_V107_GEAR_POLICY.md`,
`docs/process/CODEX_V108_SPEC.md`, and their schema files.
For v1.0.9 Decision Ledger and Evidence Convergence, use
`docs/process/CODEX_HARNESS_V1_0_9_DECISION_LEDGER_POLICY.md`,
`docs/process/CODEX_DECISION_LEDGER_SCHEMA_V1_0_9.json`,
`docs/process/CODEX_REPAIR_PLAN_SAFE_SCHEMA_V1_0_9.json`, and
`docs/process/CODEX_STATUS_TAXONOMY_V1_0_9.json`.
For v1.1.0 Token Economy and Operational Closure, use
`docs/process/CODEX_HARNESS_V1_1_0_TOKEN_ECONOMY_POLICY.md`,
`docs/process/CODEX_V110_SPEC.md`, and
`docs/process/CODEX_STATUS_TAXONOMY_V1_1_0.json`.
For v1.1.1 Token Hard Cap, Context Capsule, and Failure Closure, use
`docs/process/CODEX_HARNESS_V1_1_1_TOKEN_HARD_CAP_CONTEXT_CAPSULE_FAILURE_CLOSURE_POLICY.md`,
`docs/process/CODEX_V111_SPEC.md`, and
`docs/process/CODEX_STATUS_TAXONOMY_V1_1_1.json`.
For v1.1.2 Conversation Surface Minimization and Evidence Fidelity, use
`docs/process/CODEX_V112_SPEC.md`,
`docs/process/CODEX_HARNESS_V1_1_2_CONVERSATION_SURFACE_EVIDENCE_FIDELITY_POLICY.md`,
and the matching v1.1.2 taxonomy, reason dictionary, rollout manifest, and
command output policy files.
For v1.1.3 Minimal Surface, Fast Gates, Typed Decisions, and Compatibility
Proof, use `docs/process/CODEX_V113_SPEC.md`,
`docs/process/CODEX_HARNESS_V1_1_3_MINIMAL_SURFACE_FAST_GATES_COMPATIBILITY_PROOF_POLICY.md`,
and `docs/process/CODEX_STATUS_TAXONOMY_V1_1_3.json`.
For v1.1.4 Loop Kernel and Deterministic Guardrails, use
`docs/process/CODEX_V114_SPEC.md`. Preserve v1.1.3 safety profile, same-head
checks, token economy, raw-log prohibition, 8-session default fail, and target
rollout prohibition until a separate owner instruction authorizes rollout.
v1.1.4 finalizes Loop Kernel with Decision Core, Minimal Blockers, status
tiering, remote evidence state machine, forbidden scope IDs, and token cost
ledger.
For v1.1.5 Trace Kernel, Policy Hooks, Skill Profiles, and Token-Thin
Finalizer, use `docs/process/CODEX_V115_SPEC.md` and
`docs/process/CODEX_V115_PROFILE_REGISTRY.json`. Decision Core v2 is
authoritative. Minimal Blockers come first. Prefer trace pointers over repeated
history, and Skill Profile IDs over long forbidden text. Policy Hooks fail
closed. PR bodies are rendered human output, not machine decision sources.
Same-head required checks remain required. Raw logs, 8-session operation, and
product/harness repair mixing remain forbidden.
For v1.1.6 Decision Capsule, Evidence Precedence Kernel, and Token Hard Budget,
use `docs/process/CODEX_V116_SPEC.md`. Decision Capsule is the first decision
source. Evidence Precedence Kernel decides artifact priority. PR body is not
machine evidence. Token Hard Budget is enforced. Policy/profile IDs replace
long forbidden text. Same-head required checks remain mandatory. Raw logs and
8-session are forbidden. Product/harness repair separation is required. Target
rollout is not part of Source body tasks.

## Plan-First Rule

Use plan-first for R3, ambiguous, security-sensitive, migration, release,
dependency, multi-file, or architecture tradeoff work. Keep the plan short and
tie it to affected areas, entrypoints, and failure propagation risk.

## Safe Output Rule

Use safe summary only. Do not print raw logs, raw diffs, raw payloads, secret
values, endpoint values, private paths, production data, or personal data.

## Merge-Ready Claim Rule

Do not claim merge-ready unless required gates, current-head evidence, CI replay
where applicable, and human confirmation rules are satisfied.

## Task Discipline

Before editing, classify work as bugfix, feature, refactor, investigation,
review, release-gate, harness-change, or docs-only. For bugfix work, use the
`codex-bugfix` skill and write reproduction status plus root-cause hypothesis
before code edits unless the change is documentation-only. Keep task-specific
workflow detail in skills or `docs/process`, not in AGENTS.md.
In 5.5 low mode, keep one PR/repo focus, avoid broad changes, and return
exactly one safe next action.

## Agent Doctrine And Skill Routing

Keep AGENTS.md as a compact doctrine and routing map. Load only the skills
needed for the task, normally four or fewer and never more than five. Route
details, review matrices, containment boundaries, state-machine evidence, and
minimal evidence rules live in `docs/process/CODEX_AGENTS_DOCTRINE_POLICY.md`,
`docs/process/CODEX_SKILL_ROUTING_POLICY.md`, and the related v0.9.5 policy
files.

## Manual Confirmation Limit

Manual confirmation cannot override non-overridable failures: secret scan,
blocked paths, high-confidence sensitive findings, stale evidence, unsafe
output, implementation/harness mixing, or weakened quality gates.

## Profile/Core Separation

Root source harness version and profile template version are separate. In
`CODEX_HARNESS_MODE=core`, profiles are optional compatibility artifacts and
must not be required for core quality score.
